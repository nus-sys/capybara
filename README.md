_Demikernel_ is a library operating system (LibOS) architecture designed for use
with kernel-bypass I/O devices. This architecture offers a uniform system call
API across kernel-bypass technologies (e.g., RDMA, DPDK) and OS functionality
(e.g., a user-level networking stack for DPDK).

To read more about the motivation behind the _Demikernel_, check out
this [blog
post](http://irenezhang.net/blog/2019/05/21/demikernel.html).

To get details about the system, read our paper in [SOSP '21](https://doi.org/10.1145/3477132.3483569).

## Building

> **Follow these instructions to build Demikernel on a fresh Ubuntu 20.04 system.**

### 1. Clone This Repository

```bash
export WORKDIR=$HOME                                                  # Change this to whatever you want.
cd $WORKDIR                                                           # Switch to working directory.
git clone --recursive https://github.com/demikernel/demikernel.git    # Recursive clone.
cd $WORKDIR/demikernel                                                # Switch to repository's source tree.
```

### 2. Install Prerequisites (Only Once)

```bash
sudo -H scripts/setup/debian.sh                                   # Install third party libraries.
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh    # Get Rust toolchain.
```

### 3. Build DPDK Libraries (For Catnip and Only Once)

```bash
./scripts/setup/dpdk.sh
```

### 4. Build Demikernel with Default Parameters

```bash
make
```

### 5. Build Demikernel with Custom Parameters (Optional)

```bash
make LIBOS=[catnap|catnip|catpowder|catcollar]    # Build using a specific LibOS.
make DRIVER=[mlx4|mlx5]                           # Build using a specific driver.
make LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/libs                # Override path to shared libraries. Applicable to Catnap and Catcollar.
make PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/pkgconfig           # Override path to config files. Applicable to Catnap and Catcollar.
```

### 6. Install Artifacts (Optional)

```bash
make install                                     # Copies build artifacts to your $HOME directory.
make install INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/location    # Copies build artifacts to a specific location.
```

## Running

> **Follow these instructions to run examples that are shipped in the source tree**.

### 1. Setup Configuration File (Only Once)

- Copy the template from `scripts/config/default.yaml` to `$HOME/config.yaml`.
- Open the file in `$HOME/config.yaml` for editing and do the following:
  - Change `XX.XX.XX.XX` to match the IPv4 address of your server host.
  - Change `YY.YY.YY.YY` to match the IPv4 address of your client host.
  - Change `PPPP` to the port number that you will expose in the server host.
  - Change `ZZ.ZZ.ZZ.ZZ` to match the IPv4 address that in the local host.
  - Change `ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff` to match the MAC address in the local host.
  - Change `abcde` to match the name of the interface in the local host.
  - Change the `arp_table` according to your setup.
  - If using DPDK, change `WW:WW.W` to match the PCIe address of your NIC.
- Save the file.

### 2. Enable Huge Pages (For Catnip at Every System Reboot)

```bash
sudo -E ./scripts/setup/hugepages.sh
```

### 3. Run UDP Push-Pop Demo

> For Catnap and Catcollar, you don't need to run with super-user privileges.

```bash
# Server-Side
PEER=server TEST=udp_push_pop sudo -E make LIBOS=catnip test-system

# Client-Side
PEER=client TEST=udp_push_pop sudo -E make LIBOS=catnip test-system
```

### 4. Run UDP Ping-Pong Demo

> For Catnap and Catcollar, you don't need to run with super-user privileges.

```bash
# Server-Side
PEER=server TEST=udp_ping_pong sudo -E make LIBOS=catnip test-system

# Client-Side
PEER=client TEST=udp_ping_pong sudo -E make LIBOS=catnip test-system
```

## Documentation

- Legacy system call API documentation [`doc/syscalls.md`](./doc/syscalls.md)
- Instructions for running Demikernel on CloudLab [`doc/cloudlab.md`](./doc/cloudlab.md)

### 1. Build API Documentation (Optional)

```bash
cargo doc --no-deps    # Build API Documentation
cargo doc --open       # Open API Documentation
```

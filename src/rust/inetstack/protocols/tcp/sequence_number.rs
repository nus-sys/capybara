// This file defines a type to represent a TCP Sequence Number.
//
// RFC 793, Section 3.3 defines TCP sequence numbers.  The sequence number space ranges from 0 to 2^32 - 1.  This space
// "wraps around", so all arithmetic dealing with sequence numbers must be performed modulo 2^32.  This also means that
// excluding equality, all comparisons between sequence numbers are non-transitive.  That is, for any three distinct
// sequence numbers a, b, & c, having a < b and b < c being true does NOT necessarily imply that a < c.  One can have
// the situation that a < b < c < a.  For this reason, we define sequence numbers to be their own type.
//

use std::{
    cmp::Ordering,
    convert::From,
    fmt,
};

// Internally, we store sequence numbers as unsigned 32-bit integers.
//
// We allow our sequence numbers to be cloned, copied, created, and checked for equality the same as for u32.  We
// restrict all other behaviors to those we explicitly define below.

// We define the PartialOrd trait in order to support the "<", "<=", ">", and ">=" operators on sequence numbers.
// Strictly speaking, however, sequence numbers are not a partially ordered set (much less a totally ordered set) due to
// the fact that they wrap around.  So to avoid problems with other code that might assume our implementation of the
// PartialOrd trait means that sequence numbers can be uniquely ordered, we don't implement the partial_cmp function of
// this trait.  Well, actually we do, because the compiler complains if we don't, but we have it panic if it is called.

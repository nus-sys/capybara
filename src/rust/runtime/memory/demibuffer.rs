// This DemiBuffer type is designed to be a common abstraction defining the behavior of data buffers in Demikernel.
// It currently supports two underlying types of buffers: heap-allocated and DPDK-allocated.  The basic operations on
// DemiBuffers are designed to have equivalent behavior (effects on the data), regardless of the underlying buffer type.
// In particular, len(), adjust(), trim(), clone(), and split_back() are designed to behave the same regardless.
//
// The constructors/destructors, however, are necessarily different.  For DPDK-allocated buffers, a MBuf is expected
// to be allocated externally and provided to the DemiBuffer's "from_mbuf" constructor.  A MBuf can also be extracted
// from a DPDK allocated DemiBuffer via the "into_mbuf" routine.
//
// Note: if compiled without the "libdpdk" feature defined, the DPDK-specific functionality won't be present.

// Note on buffer chain support:
// DPDK has a concept of MBuf chaining where multiple MBufs may be linked together to form a "packet".  While the
// DemiBuffer routines for heap-allocated buffers also now support this functionality, it isn't yet exposed via the
// DemiBuffer interface.
// TODO: Expose buffer chain support once we have a solid use case.

// Note on intrusive queueing:
// Since all DemiBuffer types keep the metadata for each "view" in a separate allocated region, they can be queued
// using intrusive links (i.e. have a link field in the metadata).
// TODO: Expose calls to get/set a linking field.

// Note on the allocation functions:
// This code currently uses std::alloc() and std::dealloc() to allocate/free things from the heap.  Note that the Rust
// documentation says that these functions are expected to be deprecated in favor of their respective methods of the
// "Global" type when it and the "Allocator" trait become stable.
